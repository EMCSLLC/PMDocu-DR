**Project:** PMDocu-DR
**Maintainer:** EMCSLLC / PMDocu-DR Project Lead
**Revision:** v1.0 ‚Äì 2025-10-19
**Next Review:** 2026-04 (Semi-Annual Compliance Audit)

## üß≠ 1. Overview

This policy defines the retention, archival, and review requirements for evidence, artifacts, and audit documentation generated by the PMDocu-DR continuous integration (CI) system.

It ensures all evidence remains available for verification, regulatory review, and audit readiness, while maintaining data integrity, immutability, and controlled disposal according to organizational governance standards.

All artifacts referenced herein originate from workflows associated with the following compliance controls:

- **CI-AUT-001** ‚Äî Build & Sign Docs
- **CI-AUT-002** ‚Äî Nightly Validation & Evidence Assurance
- **CI-AUT-002-A** ‚Äî Baseline Snapshot & Release Compliance Update

## üì¶ 2. Retention Categories

| **Evidence Type** | **Path / Location** | **Retention (Days)** | **Archival Method** | **Reviewed By** |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Signed PDFs | `docs/releases/` | 30 (extendable to 90) | GPG-signed release bundles | Project Lead |
| Baseline Snapshots | `docs/releases/Baseline-*.md` | Permanent | Git-tracked, auto-generated nightly | CI Automation |
| Change Records | `docs/releases/ChangeRecord-*.md` | Permanent | Git-tracked, appended nightly | CI Automation |
| Workflow Evidence JSON | `docs/_evidence/*.json` | 30 | Automatically pruned in artifact retention | CI System |
| Lint & Analyzer Reports | `docs/_evidence/AnalyzerReport-*.json` | 30 | Retained for code-quality audits | QA/DevOps |
| Nightly Artifacts | GitHub Actions ‚Üí Artifacts (`nightly-evidence-*.zip`) | 30 | Auto-expire per workflow | GitHub |
| Governance Docs | `docs/gov/*.md` | Permanent | Version-controlled | Compliance Officer |

> Extended retention (90 days) may be approved for regulatory reviews, security audits, or compliance re-certifications.

## üîÑ 3. Review Frequency

| **Cycle** | **Scope** | **Performed By** | **Outcome** |
|------------|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| Semi-Annual (April / October) | Verify completeness of evidence and retention compliance | Project Lead + Compliance Officer | Renewal or corrective action |
| Post-Release | Validate that baseline and evidence bundles for latest tag exist | Release Engineer | Confirmation of archival |
| Ad-Hoc Audit | Triggered by internal or external review | Assigned Auditor | Signed review report |

Each review cycle must confirm:
- Evidence directories (`_evidence`, `releases`, `gov`) exist and pass validation
- Nightly workflow artifacts are accessible and within retention window
- Long-term baselines (Markdown + PDFs) are preserved in Git

## üìÅ 4. Archival and Disposal Procedure

1. **Export** ‚Äî Copy `/docs/gov/`, `/docs/_evidence/`, and `/docs/releases/` to approved offline media (encrypted USB or archival storage).
2. **Verify** ‚Äî Confirm exported copies match repo hash values via SHA-256 checksum comparison.
3. **Label** ‚Äî Tag media with retention period, project, and baseline version (e.g., `PMDocu-DR_v1.1_GovBaseline`).
4. **Dispose** ‚Äî After retention expiration, securely erase digital copies beyond their authorized retention window, ensuring no residual data remains.
5. **Record** ‚Äî Log all archival and disposal activities in the `Gov-Compliance-Review-Log.md`.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 5. Escalation and Exception Handling

If any evidence file, artifact, or signed release becomes:
- **Missing** ‚Äî Open a compliance issue and re-run the affected workflow manually.
- **Corrupted** ‚Äî Restore from latest valid nightly artifact or offline backup.
- **Needed beyond retention** ‚Äî Obtain written extension approval from the Compliance Officer; document justification in the Compliance Review Log.

Escalations must be resolved before the next semi-annual review or release tag.
