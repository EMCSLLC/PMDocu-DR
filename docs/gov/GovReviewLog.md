## 🧾 Log Maintenance

- Each review must be appended chronologically and committed with the reviewer’s GPG-signed commit.
- CI workflows must confirm that the file passes Markdown and signature validation before acceptance.
- Historical entries **must never be altered** — only new entries may be added.
- A PDF version of this file will be included in the next `docs/releases/` build.

## 🔐 Integrity Controls

| **Mechanism** | **Purpose** |
|----------------|-------------|
| GPG Signature on Commit | Ensures authenticity of reviewer approval |
| SHA-256 Hash in Evidence Directory | Confirms log integrity between reviews |
| Workflow Evidence Reference | Links to JSON verification results for traceability |
| Offline Archive Copy | Retains immutable version per retention cycle |
