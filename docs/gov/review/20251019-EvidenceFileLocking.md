# ðŸ§¾ Governance Review Entry â€” Evidence File Locking Proposal

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Reviewer:** PMDocu-DR Project Lead (EMCSLLC)
**Decision:** Shelved
**Status:** Closed

---

### Summary
A proposal was reviewed regarding the potential implementation of filesystem and Git-level read-only enforcement for the `docs/_evidence` directory.

### Decision
After evaluation, it was determined that explicit locking is not required at the current project scale.

### Rationale
- Evidence artifacts are already **timestamped**, **versioned**, and **cryptographically signed**.
- CI/CD pipelines generate these files deterministically, ensuring **reproducibility** and **integrity**.
- Git commit history and verified signatures provide sufficient **immutability** for audit trails.

### Future Considerations
This topic will be revisited if:
- Multiple developers begin contributing directly to evidence management, or
- Offline / air-gapped audit archives require additional filesystem enforcement.

---

**Outcome:**
Existing safeguards are sufficient. The locking feature is **shelved** for now and may be reconsidered in future compliance baselines.
